# Type Specimen – Local Font Viewer

A simple, lightweight tool for previewing OpenType fonts directly in your browser.  
All fonts are loaded **locally** on your device — nothing is uploaded — so you can safely test commercial, work-in-progress, or private fonts.

This project was created with the help of **ChatGPT**, as the author has very little programming experience.  
The goal was to build a clean and modern interface inspired by mid-century Swiss typography.

## Features

- Load `.otf`, `.ttf`, `.woff`, `.woff2` files locally (no upload)
- View basic font metadata (names, metrics, glyph count, etc.)
- Full **variable font** support (auto-detected axes + sliders)
- Editable sample text
- “Hello Typeface!” interactive area (pointer/tilt responsive)
- Simple word / sentence / paragraph specimens

---

## How to Use

1. Open the GitHub Pages link (or open `index.html` locally).
2. Drag & drop a font file into the page.
3. Type and explore your font in real time.
4. If the font is variable, you can adjust its axes with sliders or by moving your pointer.

That's all — no installation or setup required.
